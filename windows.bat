xcopy
/s   : Copies directories and subdirectories, unless they are empty. If you omit /s, xcopy works within a single directory. 
/e   : Copies all subdirectories, even if they are empty. Use /e with the /s and /t command-line options. 
/y   : Suppresses prompting to confirm that you want to overwrite an existing destination file. 
/i   : If Source is a directory or contains wildcards and Destination does not exist, xcopy assumes destination specifies a directory name and creates a new directory. Then, xcopy copies all specified files into the new directory. By default, xcopy prompts you to specify whether Destination is a file or a directory
